              <h5 id="common-faults">Common Washing Machine Faults and Errors</h5>
              <p>Before diving into repair services, it's essential to understand the common issues that can plague your washing machine:</p>
              <ul id="cFaults" class="cFaults">
                  <li><strong>No Power:</strong>  This could be due to a faulty power cord, plug, or electrical outlet. Additionally, check for tripped circuit breakers or blown fuses that may prevent the machine from receiving power.</li> 
                  <li><strong>No Water Intake:</strong>  A clogged water inlet valve or a kinked hose can cause this problem. Also, ensure that the water supply is turned on and that the filter screens in the hose connections are clean.</li> 
                  <li> <strong>No Water Drainage:</strong> A blocked drainpipe or a malfunctioning pump can hinder drainage. Inspect the drain hose for clogs, and check the pump for any debris or obstructions that may impede its operation.</li> 
                  <li> <strong>Machine Won't Spin:</strong> A faulty motor, belt, or drum bearing can lead to spinning issues. Additionally, the door lock mechanism may be malfunctioning, preventing the spin cycle from starting.</li> 
                  <li> <strong>Excessive Vibration and Noise:</strong> Worn-out shock absorbers or unbalanced loads can cause excessive noise and vibration. Ensure that the machine is level and that the load is distributed evenly to minimize these issues.</li> 
                  <li> <strong>Leaking Water:</strong> A damaged drum seal or a loose hose connection can result in water leaks. Inspect the door seal for wear and tear, and check the detergent drawer for clogs that could cause overflow.</li> 
                  <li> <strong>Cycle Not Completing:</strong> The washing machine may stop mid-cycle due to a malfunctioning control board or sensor. This can also be triggered by power interruptions or unbalanced loads that prevent the cycle from progressing.</li> 
                  <li> <strong>Unpleasant Odors:</strong> A buildup of detergent residue, mold, or mildew inside the drum can lead to foul smells. Regular cleaning of the drum and door seal, as well as running maintenance cycles, can help mitigate this.</li> 
                  <li> <strong>Display Issues:</strong> Malfunctions in the control panel can cause the display to flicker or become unresponsive. This could be due to electrical issues or a fault in the control board itself.</li> 
                  <li> <strong>Overheating:</strong> If the machine is overheating, it could be due to a faulty thermostat or a malfunctioning motor. This may also result from extended use without proper cooling periods. </li>
              </ul>
