                    <li><strong>White Mould:</strong> White mould can appear on damp surfaces and is commonly found in areas with high moisture, such as basements or bathrooms.</li>
                    <li><strong>Green Mould:</strong> Green mould is a common type of mould found on organic materials, including carpets and furniture. It grows in areas with excessive moisture.</li>
