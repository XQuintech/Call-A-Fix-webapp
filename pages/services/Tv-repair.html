                <p>TVs can experience a wide range of issues that may affect your viewing experience. Here are some common problems that may require repair:</p>
                <ul id="cFaults" class="cFaults">
                    <li><strong>No Picture:</strong> If your TV is powered on but there’s no image, it could be an issue with the backlight, motherboard, or faulty HDMI connections. Check your cables and input settings before calling a technician.</li>
                    <li><strong>No Sound:</strong> A TV with no sound might have issues with the speakers, audio settings, or the audio board. Ensure that the volume is up and not muted, and check external speaker connections.</li>
                    <li><strong>Flickering or Blurry Screen:</strong> This could be caused by a malfunctioning screen panel, video processor, or cable issues. Adjust the picture settings to troubleshoot or seek a professional technician if the problem persists.</li>
                    <li><strong>Screen Color Problems:</strong> If your TV displays incorrect colors, such as a washed-out image or color distortions, it might be an issue with the color settings, the panel, or the internal circuitry.</li>
                    <li><strong>TV Not Turning On:</strong> If the TV does not power up, it could be due to a faulty power supply, remote control issue, or a problem with the internal components like the motherboard or power board.</li>
                    <li><strong>Vertical/Horizontal Lines on Screen:</strong> Lines on the screen can indicate a problem with the TV's display panel or graphics card. If they appear often or are persistent, it’s best to have the TV inspected by an expert.</li>
                    <li><strong>Remote Control Not Working:</strong> If the remote control is unresponsive, it could be an issue with the remote’s batteries, the sensor on the TV, or a problem with the IR receiver.</li>
                    <li><strong>Wi-Fi or Smart TV Connectivity Issues:</strong> If your smart TV is having trouble connecting to the internet, it might be a software or hardware issue, or there could be problems with the Wi-Fi module or settings.</li>
                    <li><strong>Overheating:</strong> Overheating can occur if the ventilation system is blocked or if the TV is placed in a warm area. Overheating may damage internal components, leading to a shutdown.</li>
