                <ul>
                    <li>Experience and Expertise: Choose a painter with a solid reputation and years of experience. Look for painters who have worked on similar projects to yours.</li>
                    <li>References and Reviews: Check reviews, ratings, and references from previous clients. You can ask to see a portfolio of their past work.</li>
                    <li>Licensing and Insurance: Ensure that the painter is licensed (if required) and has liability insurance in case of accidents or property damage during the job.</li>
                    <li>Quality of Materials: Ask about the type of paint and materials they will use. A reputable painter will use high-quality paints that last longer and provide better coverage.</li>
                    <li>Quotes and Cost Transparency: Get a written estimate before the job starts. The estimate should cover labor, materials, and any other charges to avoid unexpected costs later on.</li>
                    <li>Timeframe: Confirm the start and completion dates to ensure the work is done on schedule.</li>

                    <li>Allow Time for Drying: Make sure you allow the recommended time for paint to dry and cure between coats and before use.</li>
                </ul>
        
                <h5 id="average-lifespan">Average Lifespan of Painted Surfaces</h5>
