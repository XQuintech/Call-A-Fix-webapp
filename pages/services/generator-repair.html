                <h5 id="common-faults">Common Generator Faults and Issues</h5>
                <p>Generators are prone to various issues depending on their type, usage, and maintenance. Here are some common problems that may require repair:</p>
                <ul id="cFaults" class="cFaults">
                    <li><strong>Generator Not Starting:</strong> If your generator won’t start, it may be due to a dead battery, faulty starter motor, or fuel system issues. It could also be a problem with the ignition system or a dirty air filter.</li>
                    <li><strong>Generator Stalls or Shuts Off Unexpectedly:</strong> This could indicate an issue with the fuel line, clogged filters, or an overheating problem. Check for fuel leaks, low oil levels, or clogged air filters.</li>
                    <li><strong>Low Power Output:</strong> If the generator is running but producing insufficient power, it may have a malfunctioning alternator, worn-out brushes, or issues with the regulator.</li>
                    <li><strong>Excessive Noise or Vibrations:</strong> Excessive noise may point to mechanical issues, such as worn engine parts, loose mounting bolts, or a malfunctioning exhaust system.</li>
                    <li><strong>Oil Leaks:</strong> Oil leaks can result from worn seals or gaskets. This issue can lead to engine damage if not addressed promptly.</li>
                    <li><strong>Generator Running Rough:</strong> If your generator runs rough or sputters, it could be due to fuel quality, a clogged carburetor, or a problem with the fuel injectors.</li>
                    <li><strong>Overheating:</strong> A generator may overheat due to insufficient oil, blocked ventilation, or a malfunctioning cooling fan. Regular maintenance is required to avoid this issue.</li>
                    <li><strong>Electrical Issues:</strong> Electrical problems like tripping circuits, power surges, or a lack of voltage output may stem from the alternator, regulator, or wiring issues.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>While some minor generator issues like clogged air filters or dirty spark plugs can be fixed by yourself, more serious problems, such as electrical faults, fuel system malfunctions, or overheating, require professional expertise.

                <h5 id="hiring-expert">What to Consider When Hiring a Generator Repair Expert</h5>
                <p>When hiring a generator repair technician in Nigeria, here are some key factors to keep in mind:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Experience and Specialization: Choose a technician who is experienced in repairing the type and brand of generator you own. Diesel generators, for example, require different expertise compared to gasoline generators.</li>
                    <li>Reputation and Reviews: Look for feedback from previous customers. Online reviews, recommendations from friends or family, and customer testimonials can help you find a reliable technician.</li>
                    <li>Certification and Training: Make sure the technician is certified and has received the proper training in generator repairs. This will ensure the repair is done safely and effectively.</li>
                    <li>Service Guarantee: Ask if the repair comes with a warranty or service guarantee. This provides peace of mind in case the problem persists after the repair.</li>
                    <li>Cost Transparency: Get a detailed cost estimate upfront, covering both parts and labor, to avoid any surprises later.</li>
                </ul>
