                <h5 id="common-faults">Common Car Faults and Issues</h5>
                <p>Cars can develop a wide variety of issues, but being aware of the common problems can help you identify them early and prevent costly repairs. Some of the most common car faults in Nigeria include:</p>
                <ul id="cFaults" class="cFaults">
                    <li><strong>Engine Overheating:</strong> A common issue caused by low coolant levels, a damaged radiator, or a malfunctioning thermostat. Regularly check the coolant and ensure the radiator is functioning properly.</li>
                    <li><strong>Flat Tires:</strong> Frequent tire issues can be caused by punctures, worn-out tires, or incorrect tire pressure. Check your tires regularly for wear and maintain the correct pressure.</li>
                    <li><strong>Brake Problems:</strong> Squeaky brakes, reduced braking power, or a soft brake pedal could indicate worn-out brake pads, air in the brake lines, or low brake fluid levels. Have your brakes checked regularly for safety.</li>
                    <li><strong>Engine Misfire:</strong> An engine misfire can be caused by faulty spark plugs, ignition coils, or fuel injectors. If your car jerks, hesitates, or experiences rough idling, it’s time for a diagnostic check.</li>
                    <li><strong>Battery Issues:</strong> A dead or weak battery can leave you stranded. Ensure your battery is checked for corrosion and the alternator is working properly to prevent sudden failures.</li>
                    <li><strong>Transmission Problems:</strong> Grinding noises, slipping gears, or difficulty shifting gears could signal issues with your car’s transmission. If you notice any of these symptoms, get your transmission inspected as soon as possible.</li>
                    <li><strong>Electrical Faults:</strong> Modern cars are equipped with sophisticated electrical systems. Problems such as malfunctioning headlights, power windows, or dashboard warning lights may be due to a blown fuse or faulty wiring.</li>
                    <li><strong>Suspension Issues:</strong> If your car bounces excessively, or if you notice strange noises or difficulty steering, your suspension system may be damaged or worn out. Regular checks can prevent long-term damage to your vehicle.</li>
                    <li><strong>Air Conditioning Problems:</strong> A malfunctioning AC could be due to low refrigerant, a broken compressor, or a clogged condenser. Keep your car's AC serviced to stay comfortable, especially during Nigeria’s hot months.</li>
                </ul>
