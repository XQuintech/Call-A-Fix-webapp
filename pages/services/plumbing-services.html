                <h5 id="common-plumbing-issues">Common Plumbing Issues in Nigeria</h5>
                <p>In Nigeria, plumbing issues can range from minor leaks to serious water flow and drainage problems. Here are some of the most common plumbing problems encountered:</p>
                <ul id="cFaults" class="cFaults">
                    <li><strong>Leaky Pipes:</strong> Leaks are one of the most common plumbing issues and can cause significant water damage if not addressed promptly. They often occur due to wear and tear, corrosion, or poor installation.</li>
                    <li><strong>Clogged Drains:</strong> Clogged drains in sinks, bathtubs, or toilets are caused by the accumulation of food particles, soap scum, hair, and grease. This issue is not only inconvenient but can also lead to foul odors and slow drainage.</li>
                    <li><strong>Low Water Pressure:</strong> Low water pressure can result from pipe blockages, leaks, or the buildup of minerals. It’s particularly noticeable in showers and faucets.</li>
                    <li><strong>Running Toilets:</strong> A constantly running toilet can waste a lot of water and increase your utility bill. It’s often due to a malfunctioning flapper valve or faulty fill valve inside the tank.</li>
                    <li><strong>Water Heater Issues:</strong> Problems with water heaters include lack of hot water, strange noises, or leaks. The issue could be due to a faulty thermostat, a broken heating element, or sediment buildup.</li>
                    <li><strong>Burst Pipes:</strong> Burst pipes can be catastrophic, leading to extensive water damage. This issue is more common during the dry season when pipes dry out and crack or due to freezing conditions (if applicable in some areas).</li>
                    <li><strong>Blocked Toilets:</strong> Blocked toilets can occur from the improper disposal of sanitary items or excessive waste. These need to be cleared immediately to avoid overflowing and potential water damage.</li>
                    <li><strong>Faulty Faucets and Taps:</strong> Leaking or dripping faucets are not only annoying but waste a significant amount of water. They may require a simple fix or replacement of the valve, cartridge, or washers.</li>
                </ul>
