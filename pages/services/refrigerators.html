                <h5 id="common-faults">Common Refrigerator Faults and Errors</h5>
                <p>Before calling for a repair, it’s essential to understand the common problems that can affect refrigerators:</p>
                <ul id="cFaults" class="cFaults">
                    <li><strong>Not Cooling Properly:</strong> This could be due to a broken thermostat, dirty condenser coils, or a malfunctioning compressor. Ensure the temperature setting is correct, and inspect the coils for dust and dirt buildup.</li>
                    <li><strong>Leaking Water:</strong> If your refrigerator is leaking, the defrost drain may be clogged, or the door seals may be worn out, allowing warm air to enter, causing condensation.</li>
                    <li><strong>Excessive Noise:</strong> Unusual sounds might indicate a problem with the evaporator fan or the condenser fan motor. Sometimes, a loud noise can also come from a faulty compressor or condenser coils.</li>
                    <li><strong>Freezer Not Freezing:</strong> If the freezer is not freezing food, there could be an issue with the freezer fan or a refrigerant leak. It could also be due to a blocked evaporator coil.</li>
                    <li><strong>Ice Maker Not Working:</strong> If your refrigerator has an ice maker and it’s not functioning, check the water supply line for blockages, and make sure the ice maker’s motor is working properly.</li>
                    <li><strong>Fridge Freezes Food:</strong> If the refrigerator is too cold and freezes food on its shelves, it could be an issue with the temperature control or thermostat settings.</li>
                    <li><strong>Refrigerator Not Turning On:</strong> If your fridge isn't turning on, check the power cord and outlet. It may also be due to a blown fuse or faulty control board.</li>
                    <li><strong>Foul Odors:</strong> Persistent unpleasant odors could be a sign of mold in the drain pan or dirty condenser coils. Regular cleaning can help prevent these odors from occurring.</li>
                    <li><strong>Fridge Overheating:</strong> If your refrigerator feels hot to the touch or is constantly running, it may be due to dirty condenser coils, a malfunctioning fan, or a failed thermostat.</li>
                </ul>
