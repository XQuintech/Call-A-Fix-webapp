    <div class="faq-section">
        <h2>1. How do I subscribe to a plan?</h2>
        <p>To subscribe to a plan, follow these simple steps:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Visit the <a href="/callafix-website/pages/subscribe.html" target="_blank">Subscription Page</a></strong></li>
            <li><strong>Select Your Plan:</strong> Choose the plan that best suits your needs. You will have different options based on the services you provide and the duration of the subscription.</li>
            <li><strong>Proceed to Payment:</strong> Once you’ve selected your plan, proceed to the payment page. You’ll be presented with several payment options to choose from.</li>
            <li><strong>Enter Your Details:</strong> Fill in the required information. Ensure that the email address you use during payment matches the one you used to sign up for your service provider account. This ensures that your subscription is linked to your account correctly.</li>            
            <li><strong>Complete Payment:</strong> Choose one of the payment options available and complete your payment.</li>
        </ol>
    </div>
<br>
    <div class="faq-section">
        <h2>2. How does the subscription activation work?</h2>
        <p>After completing the payment, your subscription will be activated automatically, but please ensure the following:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Matching Email:</strong> The email you use for payment must match the one you registered with during signup. This helps us confirm that the payment is for your account and activates your plan immediately.</li>
            <li><strong>Activation Confirmation:</strong> Once your payment is processed and verified, you’ll receive an email confirming the activation of your subscription. This may take a few minutes.</li>
            <li><strong>Subscription Status:</strong> The sent email will reveal the status of your subscription. If there are any issues, please contact our support team.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
<br>
    <div class="faq-section">
        <h2>3. What are the payment options available?</h2>
        <p>We offer multiple payment methods to make subscribing easy and convenient for you. The following payment options are available:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Card Payments:</strong> You can pay securely using your credit or debit card.</li>
            <li><strong>Google Pay:</strong> Use your Google Pay account to make a quick payment if you prefer mobile payments.</li>
            <li><strong>USSD:</strong> For those who prefer not to use the internet, USSD payment options are available. Follow the instructions provided on the payment page to complete payment via USSD.</li>
            <li><strong>Bank Payment:</strong> You can pay directly through your bank. Details on how to make a bank payment will be provided during the subscription process.</li>
            <li><strong>Bank Transfer:</strong> If you prefer, you can make a direct bank transfer. Once you’ve completed the transfer, provide us with the transaction details via the form on the subscription page.</li>

    <div class="faq-section">
        <h2>4. What happens if I make a payment but my subscription isn’t activated?</h2>
        <p>If you’ve completed your payment but your subscription hasn’t been activated, here’s what you should do:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Double Check the Email:</strong> Ensure the email you used during the payment process matches the one you registered with during signup. If they don't match, the system may not link your payment to your account.</li>
            <li><strong>Wait for Confirmation:</strong> Sometimes, it may take a few minutes for the payment to be processed and the subscription to be activated. Please allow some time.</li>
            <li><strong>Contact Support:</strong> If after waiting, your subscription still hasn’t been activated, please reach out to our support team</a>. Provide your payment details (such as transaction ID, email used, and payment method), and our team will assist you promptly.</li>

            <li>Navigate to the subscription section.</li>
            <li>Choose the new plan you’d like to switch to and follow the instructions to update your subscription.</li>
